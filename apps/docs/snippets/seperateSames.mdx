<Note>
Be aware that you might see duplicate autocomplete results for a single when the a station is served by multiple modes. This is because the TfL systems treats them as seperate stations. Always choose the one that matches the mode you want to use.

In the case of the Elizabeth Line, it will not have any suffix to the station name. Other modes will, such as "Stratford Underground Station" or "Stratford DLR Station".
